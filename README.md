# C Programming 

This repository contains my collection of C programs created while learning and practicing the fundamentals of C programming.  
It serves as a personal record of progress, from basic syntax to more advanced logic-building exercises.

---

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Strengthen my understanding of C programming concepts.
- Develop problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
- Maintain a structured archive of practice programs.

Each program is written, compiled, and tested individually, focusing on clarity, correctness, and adherence to standard C practices.

---

## Topics Covered
- Basic Input and Output  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Functions and Recursion  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Pattern Generation  
- Number-based Logical Programs  
- Pointers *(upcoming)*

## How to Compile and Run

### On Windows (MinGW / GCC)
```bash
gcc program.c -o program
program
```

### On Linux / macOS
```bash
gcc program.c -o program
./program
```
